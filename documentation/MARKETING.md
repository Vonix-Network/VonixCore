## Long Description (Markdown)

# 🚀 VonixCore
**The Only Server Essentials Mod You'll Ever Need.**

Stop installing 20 different mods just to get basic server features. **VonixCore** is a powerful, lightweight, and modular all-in-one solution designed for modern Minecraft servers. Whether you're running a small SMP or a large network, VonixCore provides professional-grade tools without the bloat.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛠️ Completely Modular
Every single feature in VonixCore is **toggleable**. Don't need the economy? Turn it off in the config. Only want the graves? Disable everything else. You are in complete control of your server's resources.

### 💰 Full Economy System

- **Admin Shops:** Create infinite-stock shops for players to buy/sell items.
- **Player Shops:** Allow players to create their own chest shops.
- **Jobs System:** (Coming Soon) Earn money through gameplay.

### 🏠 Essentials

- **Warps:** /setwarp, /warp, /delwarp for server-wide locations.
- **Teleportation:** /tpa, /tpahere, /tpaccept, /tpdeny logic.
- **Kits:** Create and manage starter or VIP kits easily.

### 🛡️ Protection & Logging
- **CoreProtect-style Logging:** Logs block breaks, placements, and container interactions.
- **Rollback:** define safe zones or rollback griefing with simple commands.
- **Performance:** Asynchronous database writing to ensure zero lag.

### 🪦 Flexible Graves System
- **Secure Loot:** Your items are safely stored in a grave upon death.
- **XP Recovery:** Configurable XP retention.
- **Auto-Disable:** Automatically disables itself if other popular grave mods (Graves, Corpse, YIGD, etc.) are detected, preventing conflicts!

### 🔌 Integrations
